MODULE I

Twitter is one of the most popular social media used throughout the world.
The platform provides a good medium to communicate and interact with the different peoples and give a viewpoint for any topic.  
The reach of twitter has increased in the past few years as the internet has taken a huge gain in its audience. So, keeping that in mind we thought to build an application that would help the investigators to get hold of the activity of the user on Twitter.
For the analysis of tweets first, we need to get all the tweets and perform sentiment analysis on them. To do so, we first scrape all the tweets using the TWINT -( Twitter Intelligence Tool) library that is available in python.
Using twint we scrape the tweets, store it in the JSON/CSV format using pandas, and then we can apply our nltk/textblob for the sentiment analysis of the tweets.
The analysis of both tweets and words can be done using the developed tool.
Also, we get a full list of user details that comprise of username, followers, following and bio.
On the front hand side, we have displayed all the things mentioned above.
The web interface is user friendly and can have large scale implications.
